</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Melt 2 tablespoons of grass fed butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken, 1/2 of the garlic, and Italian seasoning. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the skillet and set aside.</li>
    
    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook fresh fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
    
    <li>Meanwhile, melt remaining 4 tablespoons butter in the skillet. Add onion, mushrooms, and remaining garlic; saut√© until onion is transparent, about 5 minutes. Stir in flour, salt, and pepper; cook for 2 minutes. Slowly add milk and half-and-half; cook and stir until smooth and creamy. Stir in both cheeses until melted.</li>
    
    <li>Stir in chicken mixture and serve over cooked fettuccini. Add fresh leftover parmesean on top and Enjoy.</li>
